This repository provides corrected results and clarifications related to the paper:

Furini, F., Ljubić, I., Malaguti, E. et al. On integer and bilevel formulations for the k-vertex cut problem. Math. Prog. Comp. 12, 133–164 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-019-00167-1

The following corrections and clarifications apply to the published paper:

1. A minor error in the data processing affected some numerical results.
The corrected values are reported in this repository.

2. The paper states that CPLEX user cuts are separated by the HYB algorithm every 100 nodes.
In the actual implementation used for the computational experiments, CPLEX user cuts are separated at every node of the branch-and-cut tree.

When using the corrected results, please cite the original paper and refer to this repository as an accompanying erratum.
